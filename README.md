# Iran Weather Exploratory Data Analysis
Ali Bazrkar

## Introduction

In an ever-changing world where weather patterns significantly impact our daily lives, understanding the climate is more important than ever. This exploratory data analysis project delves into the weather data from various cities across Iran, spanning from 2011 to the present 9/13/2024. Using data sourced from **Open-Meteo**, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that can help us better understand regional weather dynamics.

The significance of this analysis extends beyond mere statistics; it has the potential to inform agricultural practices, guide urban planning, and enhance disaster preparedness. By exploring key factors such as temperature variations, precipitation patterns, and wind dynamics, we can paint a comprehensive picture of how climate trends evolve over time.

As an artist specializing in pixel, digital, and portrait art, my passion for mathematics, particularly calculus, probability, and statistics—has driven me to explore the fascinating world of artificial intelligence. My journey into machine learning began about a year ago when I encountered GANs and GPTs, sparking a desire to learn how these technologies create and analyze data.

Throughout this notebook, we will engage in a structured exploration of the dataset, starting with data visualization to identify trends and anomalies. We will then dive into detailed analyses, uncovering correlations and patterns that may have significant implications. Whether you’re a researcher, policymaker, or simply a curious observer, this analysis aims to present the findings in an accessible and engaging manner, ensuring you stay intrigued every step of the way.

This project serves as my final Data Analysis project for the **Tehran Institute of Technology - MFT** program, allowing me to apply my achieved skills in a meaningful way. Join me on this journey as we uncover the stories hidden within the data and explore the world of Iran's weather patterns!

Special thanks to my mentor, **Ahmad Mesbah** and my Data-Analyst friend **AmirHossein Fakari**.
